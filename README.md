# zsh-rc
a simple zsh config file that i put together by copying others that I like

## Pre-requisites
you need to have the following installed if you'd like to use this config
- zsh
- zsh-autosuggestions
- zsh-completions 
- zsh-syntax-highlighting
- starship prompt

> you can find everything you need to install starship on their website - https://starship.rs/
### Note
If the syntax highlighting fails to work, check the location of your zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh and change that in your .zshrc accordingly.
